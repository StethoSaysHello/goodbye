To the general Kik community... 

I was so excited to give the world my next big project, but when you all berated and attacked me while I was learning, and continue to while I improve, I realized you all honestly aren't worth it anymore. Everything I do is never right by you. "You share too much", "You should give me more", all you all want is _power_ for yourselves; I am starting to understand why people gatekeep now. There's a point I gotta call it quits, a point when I know my energy is better spent on the real world, and you all pushed me to it with the brick attempts, gore, fake cp ads, spam emails, and now attacks on the shit I host for you. Enough is enough! Enjoy the deprecated forks of the crap I had posted before I guess? lol.


Though, not all of you have always been a thorn in my shoe. To the one who inspired me to learn to be 'just like you'... To the one who had my back when I was stepped on and kicked around... And to the amazing cheerleader that keeps me going every day... You guys know who you are. Thank you, for everything.
